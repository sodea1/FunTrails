# FunTrails

Are you ready for your next outdoor adventure? FunTrails has you covered. [FunTrails](https://fun-trails.herokuapp.com/) is a clone of AllTrails, a website that curates parks, trails, and more to help you explore the outdoors. It brings together an online community of hikers, runners, bird watchers, and general outdoor enthusiasts to share their adventures. FunTrails allows users to search for various parks and/or trails, view related information (including location, trail path tracings, trail conditions, etc.), and create, edit, or delete personal reviews.
